# **Analysing Historical Data on Fatalities between Israelis and Palestinians**

Much has been said about the conflicts between Israel and Palestine over disputed territory. Obviously, Palestine is the weaker side in this conflict, seeking the right to guaranteed sovereignty in the region from international bodies such as the UN (United Nations Organisation), of which they claim to be the true owners of the region belonging to the state of Israel. It is also worth remembering the existence of terrorist groups in the region, such as Hamas, which seeks the destruction of the state of Israel, and it is worth remembering that these terrorists, although they are Palestinians, do not represent the Palestinian state. Both sides claim to be the owners of that region, however in this analysis, we will restrain ourselves to analysing only the number of fatalities in this region.

## **Objective:**


To analyse the numbers of fatalities in the region. The data was catalogued from 2000 to 2023.
